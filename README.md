 1. Introduction
 
    This assignment is aimed at building regerssion models for the Taiwanese Real Estate Valuation problem and selecting the best model among the proposed ones on the basis of various observations that will me made.
 
 2. Data
 
    Data taken from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set#

    Data Set Information: The market historical data set of real estate valuation are collected from Sindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan. This is a regression problem. The data set was randomly split into the training data set (2/3 samples) and the testing data set (1/3 samples).

    Attribute Information: The inputs are as follows:

    - X1=the transaction date (for example, 2013.250=2013 March, 2013.500=2013 June, etc.)
    - X2=the house age (unit: year)
    - X3=the distance to the nearest MRT station (unit: meter)
    - X4=the number of convenience stores in the living circle on foot (integer)
    - X5=the geographic coordinate, latitude. (unit: degree)
    - X6=the geographic coordinate, longitude. (unit: degree)
    
    The output is as follow: Y= house price of unit area (10000 New Taiwan Dollar/Ping, where Ping is a local unit, 1 Ping = 3.3 meter squared)
